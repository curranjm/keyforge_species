## Dusoz

### Description

The core of a Dusoz's body resembles a rough, leathery version of a jellyfish. They have two sets of tentacles that emerge from the bottom of their body. The inner, larger tentacles are used to grasp and manipulate objects. The number of these tentacles varies by creature, but is generally 1-5 (roll 1d10 and divide by 2, rounding down with a minimum of 1). Around the edge of the main body are a series of smaller tentacles that are constantly rotating and allow the Dusoz to hover and move. They can move efficiently in air or water and do not breathe. They have a large, single eye at top of their body on a retractable stalk that allows them near-360 degree vision, though they generally keep their eye mostly retracted to protect it. Dusoz are bioluminescent in one color that is influenced by where they come from (roll 1d10: 1,2-red (desert), 3,4-orange (desert), 5,6-yellow (arid mountains), 7-green (tropical), 8,9-blue (arctic), 10-purple (temperate)). They communicate by flashing and varying the saturation of the color of their glow. Logos has developed a device that can translate this bioluminescent communication to normal speech and transmit it wirelessly to speakers or earpieces (purchasable, medicine check to use as implant).

Little is known about the home planet of the Dusoz, but their behavior indicates it lacked many of the dangers of the Crucible. Dusoz are generally more concerned with enjoying themselves than pursing new technologies or conquering new territory. Luckily their resilient shell and acclimation to outdoor living give them the toughness to survive many dangerous situations. They are fun to be around, but easily distracted.

## Alliaveare

### Description

Alliaveare are humanoid in appearance, but comprised of hundreds of tiny armadillo-like creatures called Allia. On their home planet, Allia lived as individuals, but in the millennia since they were brought to the Crucible, they have evolved to cluster and together using their claws to form humanoid colonies. The Allia in an Alliaveare communicate through a sophisticated system not understood by outsiders, but known to be both physical and telepathic in nature. Alliaveare move by forming wheels of interconnected Allia that roll on their shells. They are small in stature, usually not much more than a meter in height, but otherwise have the proportions of a human. Alliaveare are rare in the Local Group, but are known to visit and trade there. They are well respected due to their advanced technology and willingness to assist other cultures. They have achieved a level of harmony among themselves and their neighbors that mirrors the coordination between the constituent Allia within an Alliaveare. They generally wear a cloth covering over their head to reduce the shock of their appearance. Each creature making up the Alliaveare is hypersensitive to vibrations, and so the Alliaveare perceives sound and movement through its entire body, sensing tremors in the ground and disturbances in the air.

## Guilt Ridden

### Description

The Guilt Ridden are a race of ghostly creatures, generally regarded to be cursed by some supernatural force. The source of their guilt is lost to time, but it seems to be related to a major environmental disaster precipitated by some technology they developed. This disaster is likely related to a cultural shift from faith in science and technology to the zealous worship of an entity unpronounceable in common languages but generally referred to as "greenteeth" by other species (some of the guilt ridden's prayer howls contain phrases that vaguely sound like "greenteeth"... presumably this name has nothing else to do with the guilt ridden's deity/deities). Despite their avian appearance, they move by leaping and running. They are skilled excavators, and it is said that they roam the Crucible compelled by some instinct to dig through the earth and stone. Most believe they are digging for victims of whatever catastrophe killed the physical manifestation of their species. Flightless, their wings are more like arms, and generally they have the appearance and carriage of featherless bird. They manipulate objects in the physical world using telekinesis. Their primary means of sensing the physical world is scent, and they can often be seen with their head tilted back, sniffing the air.
